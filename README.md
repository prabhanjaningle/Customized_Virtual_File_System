# Customized_Virtual_File_System
Custom Virtual File System (CVFS) implemented in C that simulates core Linux file system components such as inodes, superblock, UFDT, and file tables. Supports file creation, read/write operations, deletion, and metadata inspection through a custom shell. Entirely memory-based and designed to demonstrate operating system and file system internals.
